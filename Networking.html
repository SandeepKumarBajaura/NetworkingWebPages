    <h1><u>Data Communication</u></h1><hr/>
    <h2>What is Data Communication?</h2>
    <p>Data communication is the process of <u>transferring data from one place to another place</u> or between two locations.
    It allows <b>electronic and digital data</b> move between two networks, no matter where the two are located 
    geographically, what the data contains, or what format they are in. is called data communication</p>

    <h3><u>Components of Data communication: </u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Message</li>
        <li>Sender</li>
        <li>Receiver</li>
        <li>Transmission medium</li>
        <li>Protocol</li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <li><b>Message: </b>The data to be transmitted or communicated, which can include numbers, text, photos, sound, or video.</li>
        <li><b>Sender: </b>The computer or device (e.g., phone, tablet) that sends the message.</li>
        <li><b>Receiver: </b> computer or device that receives the message, which can be different from the sender. </b></li>
        <li><b>Transmission medium: </b> The channel through which the message is carried from sender to receiver, such as twisted pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, or wireless.</li>
        <li><b>Protocol: </b>The set of rules that govern the communication between computers. These rules are followed by both the sender and receiver.</li>
    </dl>
    <h3><u>The effectiveness of a data comminications system depends on four fundamental characteristics:</u> </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Delivery</li>
        <li> Accuracy</li>
        <li> Timeliness</li>
        <li>Jitter</li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <li><b>Delivery: </b> Data must be delivered to the <b><u>correct destination and must be received</u></b> by the intended receiver only.</li>
        <li><b>Accuracy: </b> Data delivered must be accurate. <i>Any alteration to the data during transmission renders it useless.</i></li>
        <li><b>Timeliness: </b> <u>Data must be delivered within the ideal time else it is useless.</u> In case of audio 
        and video, the data must be delivered as they are produced, in the same ordered they are produced without significant delay.</li>
        <li><b>Jitter: </b>  It is the <u>variation</u> in the arrival time of audio or video packets or <b><u>unevenly delay</u></b> in the delivery of the audio or video packets.</li>

    <h1><u>Data Flow</u></h1>
    <h2> What is data flow? </h2>
    <p>Data flow means <u>trasferring data between two device</u>. it is also known as <b>communication mode.</b></p>
    <p>Ex: Walkie-talkie, mobile phone, computer e.t.c</p>
    <h3>There are three types of communication mode</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Simplex </li>
        <li>Half Duplex</li>
        <li>Full Duplex</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1. simplex mode:</h3>
    <p>In Simplex mode, <b><u>the communication is unidirectional</u></b>, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices
     on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.</p>
     <li>The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction. </li>
     <p>Example: Monitors and keyboards &amp; mouse, T.V Remotes, Radio and television broadcast. e.t.c </p>
     <h3><u>Advantage of Simplex mode</u></h3>
     <ul>
        <li>It is the most cost-effective mode, as it only requires one communication channel</li>
        <li>Simplex mode is particularly useful in situations where feedback or response is not required, such as broadcasting or surveillance.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3><u>Disadvantage of simplex mode</u></h3>
     <ul>
            <li>Only one-way communication is possible.&lt; <i>Simplex mode is not suitable for applications that require bidirectional communication.</i>&gt;</li>
            <li>There is no way to verify if the transmitted data has been received correctly.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>2. Half-Duplex Mode: </h3>
     <p>In half-duplex mode, <b><u>each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.</u></b> When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.</p>
     <li>The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in <u>both directions at the same time.</u></li>
     <p>Example: Walkie-talkie &lt;<i>in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions.</i>&gt; </p>
    <h3><u>Advantage of Half Duplex Mode</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Half-duplex mode allows for <b>bidirectional communication,</b> which is useful in situations where devices need to send and receive data.</li>
        <li>It is a more efficient mode of communication than simplex mode, as the channel can be used for <u>both transmission and reception.</u></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>Disadvantage of Half Duplex Mode</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Half-duplex mode is less reliable than Full-Duplex mode, as both devices <u>cannot transmit at the same time.</u></li>
        <li>There is a need for coordination between the transmitting and receiving devices, which can <u>complicate the communication process.</u></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Full-Duplex Mode: </h3>
    <p>In full-duplex mode, <b>both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.</b> In full-duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways: </p>
   <li>Full-duplex mode is used when <u>communication in both directions is required all the time</u>. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions. </li>  
   <p>Example: Telephone, Video Conferencing, Live chat e.t.c.</p>
   <h3><u>Advantage of full duplex mode:</u></h3>
   <ul>
        <li>Full-duplex mode allows for <b>simultaneous bidirectional communication,</b> which is ideal for real-time applications such as video conferencing or online gaming.</li>
        <li>Full-duplex mode <b>provides a high level of reliability and accuracy,</b> as there is no need for error correction mechanisms.</li>
   </ul>
